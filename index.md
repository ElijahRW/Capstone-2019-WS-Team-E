# Capstone 2019: Team E Team Website

## The Reported Problem

A development study to promote consistency among VA audiologists in tinnitus care by refining, simplifying, and streamlining a clinical algorithm based on evidence-based research

Two previous Capstone projects created a web-based application for the Audiologist and patient in order to provide:
Questionnaires and audiological tests
Recommendations for both clinician and patient
Educational information in the form of interactive screens and videos
Referral links for interdisciplinary care.

Our task will be to create a database to collect and store data entered into the program 

## Goal
