## These next two weeks are dedicated to designing a solution for the problem:
* We will perform 2 two-week sprints.
    * End of each Sprint our team will demo the prototype of our solution to the Customer (Candice and other involved parties). It will be the responsibility of the POC (Point of Contact) to arrange these demos and involve the necessary individuals for a successful presentation.
## The next 10 weeks are dedicated to development and implementation of the solution defined in the previous two sprints.
* Quarter will be held in 5 two-week sprints:
   * End of each Sprint our team will demo the features Candice and other involved parties). It will be the responsibility of the POC to arrange these demos and involve the necessary individuals for a successful presentation.
# Communication:
* The POC’s job is to coordinate information flow and set (and maintain) customer expectations.
   * Organize meetings between the sponsor and the team members
   * Make requests of the sponsors.
   * Field questions from the sponsor.
* The POC’s job is not to gather requirements, negotiate deadlines, or deal with the sponsor’s ISP. Of course that same person may be playing some other role as well, in which case gathering requirements or negotiating deadlines may be appropriate in that other role.
* Discord Channel Emails:
   * As development proceeds, the team will submit various questions, concerns, and clarifications to a specified discord channel. It is the POC’s responsibility to compile these questions and present them to the customer as deemed fit. (Likely either via email or in person).
